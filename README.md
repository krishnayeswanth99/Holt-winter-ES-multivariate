## Holt Winter Exponential Smoothing multivariate 

We tried to implement holt winter ES method with discount as the additional feature. This repo contains one such implementations.

We used Genetic algorithm for parameter estimation (differential evolution method from scipy)

Built using these articles [https://grisha.org/blog/2016/01/29/triple-exponential-smoothing-forecasting/](https://grisha.org/blog/2016/01/29/triple-exponential-smoothing-forecasting/).
